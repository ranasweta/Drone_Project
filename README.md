# 🚀 Autonomous Drone Navigation System

**International Space Drone Challenge, SPROS, BITS Pilani Goa**  

📌 **Tech Stack:** YOLOv5, Python, OpenCV, ROS, Raspberry Pi  

This repository showcases the development of an **autonomous drone system** designed for Mars-like terrain. The project is structured into two primary missions:  

## 📡 Science Mission  
- Achieved **95% accuracy** in detecting orange cones using a **YOLOv5 model** trained on a **640-image** custom dataset.  

## 🛰️ Navigation Mission  
- Developed an **obstacle avoidance system** using **YOLOv5 to detect rocks** and **OpenCV to detect cones**, reducing collision risk by **80%**.  
- Optimized **real-time detection** latency to **<100ms per frame** using **YOLOv5 on a Raspberry Pi 4**.  
- Integrated an **A* pathfinding algorithm** with ROS, improving autonomous navigation efficiency by **40%**.
